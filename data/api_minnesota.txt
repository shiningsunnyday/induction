I will show you a large graph representing the road network of Minnesota. The nodes are numbered. I want you to identify subnetworks that visually look meaningful. If you can't see some parts of the graph due to spacing issues, focus on the parts of the graph you can see clearly first. Output as many as you can. Structure your output as follows:

- Use one row for each distinct substructure. 
- For each row, output comma-separated node numbers for exactly one of the occurrences. 
- FOR EACH ROW, OUTPUT THE COMMA-SEPARATED LIST OF NUMBERS AND NOTHING ELSE.
